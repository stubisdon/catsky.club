# Development environment (used by `npm run dev`)
# Vite loads this automatically when running in development mode.
# Portal talks to this URL. Using production here so Portal gets real site data (with url);
# requests go to catsky.club (CORS allowed by Ghost). Use same Content API key as production in .env.development.local.
VITE_GHOST_URL=https://catsky.club

# Where to proxy /ghost and /members in dev (only used if you switch Portal back to localhost).
VITE_GHOST_API_PROXY=https://catsky.club

# Content API key: set in .env.development.local (gitignored).
VITE_GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY=f6dd5a28bd25bdc6e849457dd2
