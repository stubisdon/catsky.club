# Brand Guidelines - catsky.club

Generated by Brandkite

## Color Palette Overview

catsky.club's palette weaves Warm Narrative's earthy depth to ground intimate storytelling, paired with Gentle Bond's soft neutrality for transparent community spaces, and accented by Inspired Path's subtle violet hue to evoke creative journeys and participatory sparks. This trio fosters an authentic, immersive feel that differentiates from competitors' bolder tones, emphasizing emotional connection over mass appeal. Together, they create a balanced system for digital interfaces and print materials that feels personal and inclusive.

## Color Usage Hierarchy

Establish hierarchy by using the anchor as the dominant color for key elements like headings and primary actions (60% usage), support for backgrounds and secondary text (30%), and accent sparingly for calls-to-action and highlights (10%) to maintain balance. Ensure accessibility by checking WCAG AA contrast ratios, particularly pairing the anchor and accent against the support for readability across digital screens and print.
