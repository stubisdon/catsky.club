# Catsky Core Emotional Theme

## Core Reality

I know that by making a career in art I protect what makes me feel alive, but it is more risky from a financial standpoint.

By staying in IT, I would very likely earn more money, but I would feel less alive.

This is not a hypothetical dilemma. It is a real, ongoing tradeoff.

---

## Core Tension

I am caught between **optimizing my life for money** and **protecting the parts of me that feel alive**.

Neither side is framed as wrong.
Neither side is free of cost.

---

## Emotional Theme Definition

The emotional theme of Catsky is the conscious choice between:

* a safer path that maximizes income but dulls aliveness, and
* a riskier artistic path that preserves aliveness at the cost of financial certainty,

while living with the consequences of that choice in real time, without pretending the tension is resolved.

---

## Silent Question

Can I choose the path that makes me feel alive without pretending the financial risk does not exist?

This question is not meant to be answered.
It is meant to be lived inside.

---

## Decision Filter

For any creative, business, or life decision, the following questions apply:

* Which path am I choosing in this moment?
* What am I gaining by choosing it?
* What risk, loss, or dulling am I explicitly accepting as the price?

If the cost cannot be named honestly, the decision is not ready to be shared.

## What Belongs in Catsky

Content, decisions, and experiments that:

* expose the tradeoff between money and aliveness
* document the cost of choosing art over safety
* show moments of aliveness without romanticizing them
* acknowledge financial anxiety without dramatizing it

---

## What Does Not Belong in Catsky

* claims that balance is solved
* motivational or aspirational messaging
* hustle or grind narratives
* framing fans as saviors or rescuers
* pretending art is financially neutral or safe

---

## North Star Statement

I chose the path that makes me feel alive, knowing it is less financially safe, and Catsky is the honest documentation of living inside that choice.
