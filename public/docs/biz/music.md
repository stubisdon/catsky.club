# Catsky — Musical Direction Lock (Q1 2026)

Timebox: **90 days** (Jan–Mar 2026)  
Goal: **ship consistently** and build a recognizable “Catsky” signal without creative thrash.

## One-sentence definition

**Soft, dreamy, atmospheric electronic-pop with guitar and pleasant vocals — pop/R&B structure and strong hooks — personal, emotionally honest stories.**

---

## The lane (what we are making)

### Vibe

- soft, intimate, late-night, reflective
- “pleasant” vocals (inviting, not aggressive)
- atmospheric, immersive space; emotion-first

### Structure

- pop structure as default: **verse → chorus → verse → chorus → bridge → chorus**
- hooks matter: **a clear chorus payoff** in almost every song
- bridges are allowed (and encouraged) when they deepen the emotion or meaning

### Lyrics (subject + tone)

- personal stories about **emotions, thoughts, and struggles**
- honest + specific; no motivational framing
- writing principle: **“what I feel, not what I should feel”**

---

## Sonic references (north stars, not clones)

Textural/atmospheric world:
- **Jon Hopkins — _Immunity_** (dreamy depth, space, movement)
- **Burial** (atmosphere, negative space, subtle tension)

Pop edge / vocal presence:
- **Purity Ring** (emotive clarity + hooks), but **less EDM**, more pop/R&B sensibility

---

## Sound palette (the recurring ingredients)

### Core elements (most tracks)

- **vocals**: front-and-center, warm, intimate, “close”
- **electronic foundation**: pads, sub, soft percussion; tasteful pulses
- **guitar**: clean or lightly driven; textural layers, melodic counterlines, or hook reinforcement

### Texture rules

- dreamy atmospheres, movement, and depth (pads, granular shimmer, reverbs, delays)
- “space” is a feature: silence/air is allowed; avoid overfilling

### Drums / groove

- not EDM-forward; avoid “festival” drops
- grooves can borrow from pop/R&B; feel matters more than density
- drums should support the vocal + hook, not compete with them

---

## Boundaries (what we are NOT doing in this 90-day lock)

- no hard pivot into a different genre identity
- no aggressive EDM drops or “big room” energy
- no irony/character-mask writing; stay personal and present
- no experimental detours that sacrifice the hook (experiments must still land emotionally)

---

## Production + arrangement constraints (to keep momentum)

### Default tempo range (guideline)

- **mid/slow**; choose the tempo that keeps it soft and intimate (not a hard rule)

### Track length (guideline)

- aim for **2:30–4:00** unless the song demands otherwise

### Definition of “done” (release-ready)

A track is done when:
- the **chorus hook** is undeniable (melodic + lyrical)
- vocals feel **pleasant, intimate, and intelligible**
- atmosphere supports the emotion without washing out the story
- arrangement has **a clear arc** (energy changes intentionally)
- nothing feels like it’s there “because it could be” — everything earns its place

---

## Decision filter (tie-back to the emotional theme)

Before shipping, ask:
- does this song reveal something honest about what I feel?
- does it fit the “money vs aliveness” tension-world (directly or indirectly)?
- am I choosing clarity + presence over optimization and noise?

If the cost/choice can’t be named, it’s not ready.

---

## Q1 execution note (practical reality)

You already have unfinished demos that share this sound. **The job of Q1 is finishing + shipping**, not reinventing:
- pick the best demos
- tighten hooks, structure, and vocal clarity
- keep the palette consistent
