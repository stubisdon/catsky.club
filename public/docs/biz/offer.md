# catsky.club — Offer (Phase 1 / Q1 2026)

Purpose: define the **free tier**, the **paid membership**, and the **language** we use to describe them.

Non-negotiables:
- no promises of transformation
- no hustle/grind tone
- no guilt, no rescue framing
- this is about **presence**, **depth**, and supporting the artist’s path

---

## Free tier (email)

Name (working): **letters**

What it is:
- occasional emails from catsky
- short updates: what I’m making, what I’m learning, what I’m living inside
- sometimes a public link to a song, a note, or an excerpt

Frequency (target):
- **1–2 emails/month** (keep it sustainable)

What it’s for:
- a quiet connection channel
- a way for people to follow without pressure

---

## Paid membership (recurring)

Name (working): **close**

What members get (Phase 1 scope):
- **member-only page** with everything in one place (simple, no feeds)
- **early access** to releases + drafts (when it makes sense)
- **1 monthly “backstage artifact”** (choose one each month):
  - demo + voice note explaining the story / emotion
  - unfinished fragment + what I’m trying to translate
  - lyrics + annotations
  - a private mini-essay about the tradeoff (money vs aliveness) in real time
- **1 monthly immersive experience** tied to a release (when available)

What members are *really* funding:
- the ability for catsky to choose aliveness more often
- time and attention for finishing songs and building the intimate experience layer

Boundaries:
- not a community product in Phase 1
- no expectation of constant output
- fewer, deeper drops > frequent content

---

## Price

**$20/month** (single tier for Phase 1 / Q1 2026)

Rule: **no discounts, no urgency**.

---

## One-paragraph offer description (draft)

catsky.club is a small, quiet place to stay close to the music while it’s still becoming. if you join, you’ll get early access to songs and drafts, plus one monthly backstage artifact — demos, voice notes, lyrics, and honest context that doesn’t fit anywhere else. this isn’t self-improvement and it isn’t content. it’s presence — and a way to help me keep choosing the path that makes me feel alive.

## Open questions (to finalize in 10 minutes)

1) Do you want the membership name to be **close**, or something else?  
2) Do you want the free tier name to be **letters**, or something else?
