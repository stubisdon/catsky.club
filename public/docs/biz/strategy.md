# business strategy – catsky.club (revised)

## 1. core reframing: what “fan” means here

catsky.club uses the word *fan* in its original sense, not the content economy sense.

a fan is not a consumer.
a fan is someone who chooses proximity to an artist’s unfolding trajectory.

we distinguish four levels of relationship:

• listener – consumes finished work  
• audience member – follows, attends, recognizes  
• fan – emotionally resonant, follows the arc  
• superfan – seeks closeness, tolerates uncertainty  

catsky.club is designed **only** for fans and superfans.
listeners and casual audience members are intentionally not optimized for.

---

## 2. phase model (clarified)

### phase 1. artist first, proximity first

**goal:**  
convert a small number of fans into superfans who choose ongoing proximity.

**explicit non goals:**  
• mass audience growth  
• platform building  
• content volume  
• optimization for scale  

this phase prioritizes **signal quality over speed**, even at the cost of short term revenue.

---

### phase 1 target economics (unchanged, reframed)

• ~200 paying members  
• $15–$20/month  
• income comes from depth, not reach  

these members are not customers.
they are witnesses.

---

## 3. what catsky.club is in phase 1

catsky.club is:

• a personal fan operating system  
• a single artist space  
• opinionated and small  
• designed for proximity, not performance  

it is **not**:

• a platform  
• a community product  
• a content subscription  
• a creator funnel  

---

## 4. correct relationship ladder (operating assumption)

### listener
monetization: streaming, incidental tickets  
no direct asks.

### audience member
monetization: merch, shows, occasional support  
$5–$15 sporadic asks acceptable.

### fan
monetization: repeat support, recurring presence  
$5–$15/month feels natural.

### superfan
monetization: paid proximity  
$20/month is appropriate when framed as closeness, not utility.

catsky.club intentionally targets **superfan territory**.

---

## 5. long term note (unchanged, scoped)

future phases may include:
• tooling  
• additional artists  
• deeper collaboration  

these are **phase 2+ decisions**.
phase 1 rules are intentionally restrictive to prevent drift.

if someone stays through quiet periods
and still feels closer rather than disappointed,
the system is working.
