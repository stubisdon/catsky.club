Business Strategy - catsky.club

Core Emotional Theme (Foundational Artifact)

This strategy is anchored in a single emotional reality:

By choosing a career in art, I protect what makes me feel alive, while accepting higher financial risk.
By staying in IT, I would likely earn more money, while accepting a dulling of aliveness.

This is not a hypothetical dilemma. It is an ongoing, lived tradeoff.

Core tension:
I am caught between optimizing my life for money and protecting the parts of me that feel alive.

Emotional theme definition:
Catsky documents the conscious choice between a safer, higher-income path that dulls aliveness and a riskier artistic path that preserves aliveness at the cost of financial certainty, without pretending this tension is resolved.

Decision filter:
For any creative or business decision:
	•	Which path am I choosing in this moment?
	•	What am I gaining?
	•	What risk or loss am I explicitly accepting as the price?

If the cost cannot be named honestly, the decision does not belong in Catsky.

1. Your Background Is an Advantage, with One Caveat

You have three rare overlaps:
	•	B2B SaaS + AI gives you system thinking and monetization discipline
	•	Creative agency + video ads gives you production speed and narrative instincts
	•	Metal band leader gives you lived experience of audience, grind, and creative identity

The Caveat

Your B2B reflex will push you to over-abstract too early. Artist businesses fail when they try to productize before emotional pull exists.

Rule to Internalize

Art creates gravity. Tech only amplifies it.

2. The Correct Phase Model for catsky

Phase 1. Artist-First, Zero Platform Ambition

Goal: Replace a meaningful chunk of income with fans

What catsky.club is here:
	•	Your personal fan operating system
	•	Single artist
	•	Opinionated
	•	Slightly weird
	•	Clearly about you

What you build:
	•	Landing page
	•	One immersive story tied to one release
	•	Memberships first, donations second
	•	Email as the primary retention channel

Success metric:
	•	200 paying members at $15–20/month
	•	Not traffic, not polish, not AI

If this fails, stop. No tech company should be built.

⸻

Phase 2. Internal Tooling, Not a Product

Goal: Reduce your own creative and operational load

What you build:
	•	Storytelling templates
	•	Content pipelines
	•	Semi-automated editing
	•	Internal AI helpers

Important:
This is not a startup. This is leverage.

Success metric:
	•	You can produce 2–3x content with the same energy
	•	Retention improves without more effort

Still no platform, no other artists.

⸻

Phase 3. Quiet Replication with 2–3 Trusted Artists

Goal: Test transferability

What changes:
	•	You invite a few artists with existing audiences
	•	You manually onboard them
	•	You watch where they struggle

What you are validating:
	•	Is the value you get coming from tech or from you
	•	Can someone else replicate results with guidance and tooling

Success metric:
	•	At least one other artist hits meaningful recurring revenue
	•	Without you being their main driver

This phase determines everything.

⸻

Phase 4. Only Now Does a Tech Company Exist

Goal: Formalize what already works

Now catsky becomes:
	•	A creator infrastructure company
	•	Focused on deep fans, not mass creators
	•	Priced on value created, not features

Likely customer:
	•	Serious independent artists
	•	Not influencers
	•	Not hobbyists

⸻

3. Where Your AI Ideas Actually Fit

The AI vlog and collaborative editing idea is strong, but:
	•	It is not your wedge
	•	It is not your MVP
	•	It is a retention and leverage tool

Best use early:
	•	Backstage experience for fans
	•	Co-creation signaling
	•	Making fans feel invested, not productive

Best use later:
	•	Internal creator tooling
	•	Then possibly a separate product line

Do not let it become the center too early.

⸻

4. Hard Truth Checkpoints

You Should Stop or Pivot If:
	•	You cannot convert attention into paid support
	•	You feel drained instead of energized by fan interaction
	•	The story matters less than the tech in your mind

You Should Double Down If:
	•	A small group of fans becomes emotionally invested
	•	People talk about you, not the platform
	•	Content creation starts compounding instead of resetting

⸻

5. Honest Conclusion

Your plan is viable because you are willing to start small and personal.

It is not viable if:
	•	You treat this like a startup from day one
	•	You chase platform narratives before proving fan economics
	•	You hide behind tech instead of stepping forward as the artist

The strongest signal you can produce is not an MVP.
It is people paying you every month because they care.
