# catsky.club — free vs paid strategy (v1, revised)

this document defines boundaries for phase 1 only.
later phases may intentionally break these rules.
drift is not allowed.

---

## core principle

catsky.club is not a content subscription.
it is paid proximity to an unfolding artistic process.

free = orientation (listener → audience)  
paid = proximity (fan → superfan)

---

## proximity levels this system serves

• free supports listeners and audience members  
• paid is legible only to superfans  

if someone at a lower level feels tempted to join paid,
the framing is wrong.

---

## free access

### purpose
free exists to answer one question only:

do i resonate with this person at all?

it must not create desire through withholding.

---

### what free includes
• public writing and fragments  
• finished pieces that stand on their own  
• tone, worldview, pace  
• presence without address  

free content should feel complete but distant.

---

### what free must never include
• continuity across posts  
• references to “inside” or “members”  
• cliffhangers  
• process, backstory, or decision context  
• cadence promises (newsletters, schedules)  

free is not a funnel.
it is a threshold.

---

## paid access (members)

### purpose
paid exists for superfans who want proximity,
not output.

people do not pay for more.
they pay for less distance.

---

### what paid includes
• work in motion  
• thoughts before they settle  
• doubts, decisions, shifts  
• context that would feel wrong to broadcast  
• writing or audio addressed to a small room  
• continuity even when little is released  

paid content may be uneven, unfinished, or sparse.

---

### what paid explicitly does not promise
• posting frequency  
• volume  
• polished artifacts  
• tutorials or how tos  
• perks, bonuses, or drops  

if a song, video, or artifact appears,
it appears naturally.
it is never sold.

---

### required boundary language
this must be visible on the site:

this is not a content subscription.  
there may be weeks with very little output.  
this space values presence over productivity.  
if you are looking for consistent drops or perks, this is not for you.

---

## pricing rules (phase 1)

• one paid tier  
• monthly only  
• no annual yet  
• no discounts  
• no comparisons  

price is a filter, not a reward.

---

## decision test before publishing

ask:
does this increase proximity or just add content?

if it adds content, it does not belong behind pay.
if it increases closeness, it does.

---

## success condition

if someone leaves after several quiet weeks
and still feels it was worth being there,
the system is functioning correctly.
